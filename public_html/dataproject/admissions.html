        <h1>Admissions (Khush)</h1>
        <center><p>Many interesting trends can be seen in these graphs. For example, as male college rates were high prior to the 1990s, they were overtaken by women in 1990, who have maintained a 15% higher college admissions rate to the modern day. Race is also a key factor, and shows to emphasize the importance and accessibility of college to various racial groups. While Asian admissions rates have been traditionally high, a significant rise can be noticed in the hispanic population after 2010 as a result of new financial aid programs put out by FAFSA. All the other groups exhibit a slightly upwards trend, as college becomes more critical to modern society.</p></center>
