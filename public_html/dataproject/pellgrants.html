        <h1>Pell Grants (Barron)</h1>
        <center><p>Accessing college tends to require lots of money. Because of this, many families are not able to afford to pay for such universities. Thus, undergraduate students that are in great financial need are eligible for pell grants.<br><br>What is a pell grant?<br>Federal pell grants are financial aid gifted to students to help them pay for education. Unlike loans, they are not required to be paid back (under most conditions). Eligibility for one depends on the circumstances of your attendance to school and your family's ability to economically support itself. Remaining eligible for a pell grant is mainly based on submitting a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form.<br><br>There are numerous limiting conditions to receiving a pell grant, including your history in the educational system and not having any record of a sexual offense. Age is also a major factor: in general, the more young you are, the higher your eligibility for one can be. The graph below presents this idea by showing the distribution of pell grants sorted by age 2-3 years ago. <br><br>The actual numbers of the distribution are as follows:<br>19 or younger (1,491,762)<br>20 to 23 (2,141,351)<br>24 to 30 (1,395,596)<br>31 to 40 (804,106)<br>41 and Older (388,589)<br>(Total Number of People: 6,221,404)</p></center>
